# Concrete Mix Optimization with Machine Learning

• Utilized deep neural networks to predict the compressive strength of concrete mixes based on input parameters
• Implemented decision trees to efficiently categorize a diverse dataset comprising over 2500 concrete mixtures
• Utilized variable importance charts to identify crucial components in concrete mix design
• Conducted comparative analysis, benchmarking the outcomes against classical/linear and sequential techniques
